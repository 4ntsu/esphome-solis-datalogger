# ESPHome Solis Datalogger

This repository contains the ESPhome code needed to build a custom datalogger for your Solis/Ginlong Solar Inverter.
For intructions on how to wire the datalogger, see the [Hardware section in this repo][1] or my [blog post][2].
For mine, I have used an ESP32-C3 Super Mini, but any microcontroller with wifi and supported by ESPHome should work.
For more details about my particular setup, see [my blog post][2].
